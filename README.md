## Hi, I'm Jorge 👋
**Software Developer** specializing in scalable web applications and e-commerce platforms.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I build things for the web. Mostly e-commerce platforms that need to handle a lot of traffic without falling over.

**What I work with:** JavaScript/TypeScript across the stack—React for interfaces, Node.js for APIs, GraphQL when REST gets annoying, and enough DevOps knowledge to deploy without panicking.

**What I care about:** Clean code, good architecture, build it mindset, and helping other developers level up.

I have been 10+ years doing this, and I am enjoying it. Based in Munich.

## 🌱 Currently Exploring

- Full-stack TypeScript development patterns
- GraphQL API design and performance optimization
- Microservices architecture and system design
- Cloud infrastructure and containerization strategies
